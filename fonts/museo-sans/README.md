# Museo Sans web fonts

Place the licensed Museo Sans webfont files in this directory. Filenames must match the CSS references in `styles/museo-sans.css`:

- MuseoSans-300.woff2
- MuseoSans-300.woff
- MuseoSans-500.woff2
- MuseoSans-500.woff
- MuseoSans-700.woff2
- MuseoSans-700.woff
- MuseoSans-900.woff2
- MuseoSans-900.woff

Notes:
- Only add files you are licensed to use. Museo Sans is a commercial font.
- Prefer WOFF2 (smaller, faster). Keep WOFF as a fallback for older browsers.
- After adding files, no code changes are required; the site will load Museo Sans with `font-display: swap` and fall back to Open Sans when unavailable.
